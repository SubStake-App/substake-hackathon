# SubStake Team - OneBlock+ Hackathon 2022
> We Build One-stop Staking Curation Platform for DotSama Ecosystem. 


# Introduction to SubStake	
SubStake App (expo-request) is desktop/mobile application for controlling staked-weights throughout the Relaychain & Parachain ecosystem based on curation, supporting any stakable assets and voting with an optimized & user-friendly interface.

We are a team of Polkadot Head/Regional Ambassadors from East Asia, running collator nodes in various parachains & building tools to find the best collators/validators from Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem, and SubStake App is our first product to showcase the overall results of our up-to-date analysis, which will encourage staking activities to become easier and smoother in terms of UX/UI perspectives. 

Our goal for SubStake App is to build open source, community oriented mobile applications which will be unbiased to any networks, provide as many staking features as possible to the user, without having to know any technical aspects of extrinsics or chain-state to stake their assets.
## To Summarize, SubStake is:
```
- Non-custodial & decentralized, communicates directly with the blockchain nodes
- an app with top-notch UX/UI, performance & security
- An one-stop platform for all stakable networks with their stakable assets
- Most profitable nodes are curated & optimized individually to each delegator based on the userâ€™s preferences and stakable amount
```

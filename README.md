## Flow

> User who stakes first time
> 
1. Users import their pre-existed wallet using Mnemonic/json file
2. Choose stakeable asset. For Hackathon demo, we are planning to use "WestEnd" "MoonbaseAlpha"
3. User put stake amount
4. If user's stake amount is not satisfied with minimum-bond, we recommend 'nomination pool'
5. We recommend our curated validators to Users 
6. User touch 'stake' button and done.

> User who wants to stake more

> User who wants to stake less

> User who wants to chill their staked asset
